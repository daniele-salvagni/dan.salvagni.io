title: Wake On Lan using an ESP32 Telegram bot
publishDate: 2022-08-26

excerpt:
  An embeddedd ESP32 M5Atom Telegram bot for sending a Wake-on-Lan magic packet
  on the local network to turn on my PC from anywhere.
---

I wanted a simple way to be able to turn on my PC from anywhere without having
to choose one of the following:

**Port Forwarding:** As most consumer routers don't support forwarding broadcast
packets, this would imply having to make a DHCP reservation for the device that
needs waking up so that the local IP will not change. Also, in case of internet
connections with dynamic IP, a DDNS service would be required.

**Local Server:** This would require having to maintain a small local server
like a Raspberry Pi and having it powered on 24/7. They don't consume much power
but it's overkill and if you run them from an SD card it often gets corrupted.

I wanted something reliable that I could quickly setup and then mostly forget
about it. The solution I came up with was to host a simple Telegram Bot on an
**ESP32** board, it will:

1. Connect to the local network via WiFI
2. Wait for the `/wol` command on Telegram
3. Broadcast the Wake-on-Lan packet on the local network

ü™ô The power consumption is very low, less than half a watt, so you can keep it
running for about **1$** in electricity per year.

It keeps working if you buy a new router, it does not depend on my public or
local IP staying the same and you don't have to keep a linux server running for
such a simple task.

## The Wake on Lan "Magic Packet"

Most motherboards support the "Wake-on-Lan" (WOL) function. This works by
sending a packet of data called a "Magic Packet". When this packet is received
by the target macine, its network interface wakes up the rest of the computer.

The magic packet consists of the following parts:

- **Header:** 6 Bytes which is nothing but 6 bytes of 0xff.
- **Data:** 16\*6 Bytes, the MAC Address of the target device repeated 16 times.

Some clients require a password in the packet known as **SecureOn** and it will
be attached at the end.

```
FF FF FF FF FF FF |    Mac Address    |    Mac Address    |    Mac Address
   Mac Address    |    Mac Address    |    Mac Address    |    Mac Address
   Mac Address    |    Mac Address    |    Mac Address    |    Mac Address
   Mac Address    |    Mac Address    |    Mac Address    |    Mac Address
   Mac Address    |     Password      |
```

This feature usually needs to be enabled from both the BIOS _and_ the operating
system of the PC/server you want to wake up. Here is a screenshot of the setting
in my BIOS:

To **enable Wake-on-Lan on Windows** you can go to _Device Manager => Network
Adapters => Properties_. Then enable _"Wake on Magic Packet"_ in the _Advanced_
tab and check _"Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer"_ in the _Power
Management tab_.

**Fast Startup** also needs to be disabled (_Power Options => "Choose what the
power buttons do"_) as it will conflict with this feature.

## The sketch

I am using an ESP32 board called **M5Atom**, it is pretty small and can be
powered by USB type-c. It's a pretty simple project, so I am using the **Arduino
IDE** for ease of use.

The code should be pretty simple to understand and can be found on my Github at
https://github.com/daniele-salvagni/wol-bot-esp32

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

In orfer to compile, the following extra libraries can be installed from the
Library Manager:

- [M5Atom](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/m5atom/): needed for
  the M5Atom board
- [WakeOnLan](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/wakeonlan/): for
  sending the magic packet
- [UniversalTelegramBot](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/universaltelegrambot/):
  for using the Telegram API

```cpp
// WiFi configuration
#define WIFI_SSID "<wifi-network-name>"
#define WIFI_PASS "<wifi-password>"

// MAC address of the target device
#define MAC_ADDR "00:00:00:00:00:00"

// Telegram Bot Token
#define BOT_TOKEN  "<telegram-bot-token-id>"
#define ALLOWED_ID "<id-for-the-allowed-user>"
```

Then you just need to fill your WiFi configuration and MAC Address, your
Telegram bot token and your Telegram User ID so no one else can use the bot. You
can use [@Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) to create a new bot and
[@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get your ID.

### üîé Usage

![Telegram Bot](/assets/img/content/004/telegram.png)

- Use `/start` to get a list of the available commands
- Use the `/wol` command or press the physical button to turn on your PC
- Use the `/ping` command to check if the bot is online

### üêõ Debugging with Wireshark

If you encounter any issues you can use Wireshark and filter for WOL packets to
check what's going wrong:

### ‚úÖ TODO List

- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Store network configuration in EEPROM
- [ ] Add configuration commands to Telegram bot
