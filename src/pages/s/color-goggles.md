ColorGoggles is an extremely lightweight application that automatically manages
your digital saturation (**unlocked up to 320%**) when opening certain games or
software to enhance visibility.

This is an alternative to VibranceGUI for **Intel HD Graphics** or
**dual-graphics laptops**. The application is absolutely VAC safe, it does use
the same functions as the Intel Control Panel but with the limits removed, many
professional players are also known to tweak their digital saturation.

Intel did not release any public APIs so I had to make this tool by reverse
engineering the Intel Control Panel and some related driver libraries, contact
me if you have any problems.

At the moment this app might need an update, Intel changed many things again and
it may have issues with some newer drivers.

## Installation instructions

- **Download** and extract the .zip archive;
- Open `C:\Windows\System32` and use the **Search** function to find a file
  named `igfxDHLib.dll` (_it sould be in the `DriverStore` subfolder but that's
  not always the case_);
- **Copy** of `igfxDHLib.dll` in the same folder as `Color-Goggles.exe`;
- **Run** `Color-Goggles.exe`.

There are multiple versions of `igfxDHLib.dll` depending on your drivers version
and device, so you must use your own. If you can't find this file your drivers
are either too old or your device is not supported, there are a couple
discussions about this on GitHub with more information.
