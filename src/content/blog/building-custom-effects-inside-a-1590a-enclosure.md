## Smolâ„¢ Woolly Mammoth ðŸ¦£ fuzz effect

I was looking for a fuzz guitar effect and I really liked the sound of the
**Woolly Mammoth**, but I also wanted something in a small 1590A enclosure
format. As not much was available, I decided to build it myself. I did some
research on schematics based on the classic Woolly Mammoth fuzz pedal and I
started building it on a perfboard with not much planning. 1590A are much
smaller than standard enclosures, there isn't much room inside, so knew I had to
use SMD components where I could. Most components are from
[Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) which I highly recommend,
they have many parts to build your own pedals which are very cheap and could be
hard to find elsewhere.

A preview of the finished pedal, I'm pretty happy with the result :)

I started by adding a couple of pots and enlarging some holes on the board to
fit the shielding stabilizers.

Drilled some holes in the 1590A enclosure to fit the knobs.

I started fitting the first SMD components between solder joints, they are the
right size to fit nicely in between.

Added more components, I added an IC socket which will be used to fit the 2
transistor in case I'd have to swap them out at some point.

![Smol Mammoth](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/m06.webp)

Some jumper wires and more SMD components between solder joints (they can be
hard to spot).

![Smol Mammoth](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/m07.webp)

More drilling for DC power, input and putput 6.3mm jacks, a LED and the main
knob. Ilso wanted to give an antique look so I sanded with some grainy sandpaper
and left all the imperfections, I even added some more by beating it with some
tools. I then sprayed some matte black spray paint onto a paper towel and
brushed it onto the surface. I then removed the excess paint with fine grained
sandpaper and polished the edges a bit more.

All components are now there plus wires for VCC, GND, Send and Return. At this
point I also cut the perfboard to length.

Not the prettiest soldering job (I was also missing some eqpipment) but I guess
if it works... It wasn't the easiest either.

![Smol Mammoth](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/m10.webp)

I prepared an amber LED with a 330ohm resistor hidden inside the red heatshrink.

![Smol Mammoth](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/m11.webp)

Test fit, I don't have a single millimeter to spare.

Gut shot before closing, I also insulated the inside of the bottom plate with
some Kapton tape to avoid shorts.

![Smol Mammoth](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/m13.webp)

Aaaaand it's done!

![Smol Mammoth](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/m14.webp)

Fits right in :) After some thesting I'm convinced that this is the best
sounding effect on my pedalboard, so I'd call it a s success! ðŸŽ¸

## Smolâ„¢ Tentacle ðŸ¦‘ octave effect

In the same week I finished the fuzz pedal I also started building a Tentacle,
an octabe effect based on the **Green Ringer** / **EDQ Tentacle**. Again, I
wanted to build it inside a 1590A enclosure.

I'm still not sure how to use this effect honestly but it seems fun combined
with other effects, it does sound better from about the 10th fret and up on the
neck pickup.

![Smol Tentacle](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/t01.webp)

This time I did try something different with the enclosure by giving it a matte
look. I also added the image of a squid by using a toner transfer method: I
printed the image on a piece of glossy newspaper and then transferred it on the
enclosure with the heat of an iron.

Two euro coin for scale. This is the perfboard top side. Don't mind the
transistors as some were in the wrong orientation, I fixed this later.

![Smol Tentacle](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/t03.webp)

And this is the bottom side, this time there are no knobs.

![Smol Tentacle](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/t04.webp)

I call this technique _"parkour"_. This was a work in progress so some joints
were still not soldered. Combining through-hole and SMD components can solve a
lot of routing problems.

![Smol Tentacle](/img/blog/guitar-effects-custom/t05.webp)

Gut shot before closing it up showing the 6.3mm jacks and a lot of wiring.

And the finished product. I really like the effect of the quid eyes lighting up
on this one ðŸ¦‘.
